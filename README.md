### About
This assignment is aimed at helping you demonstrate and solidify your understanding of React components, props and state. 

To solve this problem, you will need to create a new react app. You can use either create-react-app or vite. 


### 1. Visit https://www.google.com/. 

#### a. Do a component breakdown analysis and list out the components you discovered
    
    - main components: 
- container

- header 
    -  menu items links - (gmail, images), 
    - app launcher, 
    - avatar component.

- google-img 
    - google image component.

- search 
    - search form - (search icon, search input, search by voice, search by image), 
    - menu links - google search, i'm feeling lucky.

- language 
    - offered languages links

- footer 
    - location, 
    - left menu items - (about, advertising, business, how it works),
    - center text - (carbon neutral since 2007), 
    - right menu items - (privacy, terms, settings).

#### b. Implement the Google homepage using React components. Remember to use props for components that are reused.

### 2. Demonstrating the use of state
Now, you have successfully implemented the Google homepage. To demonstrate the use of states, implement a solution such that, when you enter any search keyword in the search bar, and click on the ‘Enter’ key on your keyboard, the search keyword is displayed directly under the Search bar.
